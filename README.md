🏡 Real Estate Data Analysis & Visualization Project

This project showcases the complete process of transforming raw real estate data into clear, insightful visualizations using structured data analytics techniques.

The original dataset was unprepared for analysis. It contained irrelevant columns, inconsistent formats, and values that could not be used directly.
I began with data cleaning, where unnecessary fields were removed, data types were corrected, and the dataset was structured for accuracy and usability.

After cleaning, I moved to data transformation, creating calculated metrics such as:

Average property prices

Price comparison between different areas

Identification of the most expensive and least expensive locations

These transformations helped uncover patterns and trends that were not visible in the raw data.

Finally, the transformed dataset was visualized using Power BI, resulting in interactive dashboards that clearly present insights about pricing and location-based differences in the real estate market.
